# Slice ledger

The single answer to "what is being worked on". Your memory is not this file.
`pm` owns it; `dev_gatekeeper` updates branch/worktree state as it cuts and closes.

**Rules**
- One slice = one worktree = one branch, cut by `dev_gatekeeper` from `origin/dev`.
- A builder or reviewer never creates a worktree or branch.
- A worktree whose branch is an ancestor of `origin/dev` is closed, not worked in.
- A slice is `planned → open → in-review → merged`, or `dropped` with a reason.

---

## Open

| Slice | Pod | Branch | Worktree | Base | State | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `S-001` | uiux | `test/topology-all-view-modes` | *(cut at open)* | `origin/dev` | `in-review` | `pod_uiux.builder` |

### S-001 — topology view-mode claims (PR #50)

- **What:** `ui-topology` states what each network view claims, in four distinct
  states, with a guard that no view renders fabricated devices.
- **Why:** PR #33 removed fabricated stations from the render path; the guard for the
  shape was never added, so the class could come back silently.
- **Done when:** the four-state set is honest and the guard goes red on an injected
  fabricated device.
- **Verification:** `pnpm --filter @mythos/ui-topology test` plus the full
  `./scripts/check.sh`.
- **Open question carried from review:** `UNREACHABLE` is a health claim mixed onto a
  provenance axis. Two axes may be the correct answer. Decide before merge.
- **Remote state:** PR #50 open, base `dev`, mergeable.

## Carried over from the previous rig (open queue rows)

`pm` decides which of these become slices. They are recorded so the work is not lost;
none of them is assigned.

| Origin qitem | Pod | State | What |
|---|---|---|---|
| `qitem-20261023085422` | uiux | blocked | HMI canvas has no live-telemetry path; every faceplate reads NOT BOUND on a real plant. **Needs a scope decision** (advisor gate). |
| `qitem-20261026053023` | hmi | blocked | Operator-writable setpoints vs telemetry re-sync: needs a draft-vs-committed rule before coding. |
| `qitem-20261026063940` | uiux | blocked | Two same-named `InterlockCondition` types in `ui-faceplate-lib` and `ui-inspector`. Naming smell, not a wrong import. |
| `qitem-20261027083546` | backend | blocked | CLI `--version` pinning and `versions --remote`; blocked on the release path producing more than one version. Rerouted from the removed `publisher` seat. |

## Removed from the ledger

| Row | Why |
|---|---|
| `qitem-20261110082629` (worktree sweep) | Executed 2026-11-11: 13 merged worktrees and 8 merged branches removed, 19 → 6 worktrees. Both "dirty" worktrees were already shipped in `origin/dev` (diffs empty), so no review finding was lost. |
| `qitem-recovery-77ae3bf3` | Synthetic stuck-sweep row for the row above; closed with it. |

## Closed

| Slice | Branch | PR | Merged at | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| — | `feat/uiux-shell` | #15 | in `dev` | Superseded; worktree retained by mistake. |
| — | `feat/backend-core` | — | in `dev` | Worktree retained by mistake. |
| — | `fix/sweep-content-default-order` | #47 | in `dev` | |
| — | `test/faceplate-dirty-gate-clears` | #44 | in `dev` | |
| — | `perf/ci-wall-time` | #54 | in `dev` | |
| — | `feat/channel-identity` | #53 | in `dev` | |
| — | `ci/frontend-gate` | — | **not merged** | 7 commits, `ci.yml` +90 lines. Rebase and slice. |
| — | `docs/spi-sections-4-7-rewrite` | — | **not merged** | 2 commits on top of a base 102 commits behind `dev`. Rebase and slice. |
| — | `feat/ui-isa101-consolidation` | — | **not merged, do not merge** | Based on a stale point; merging as-is deletes 17,328 lines of `dev`. Salvage by hand or drop. |

## Deleted with the previous rig

14 seat conversations from the old `mythos-org` (archived on the rebuild) are not
resumed. Their open work is the table above; anything not in this file is gone.
